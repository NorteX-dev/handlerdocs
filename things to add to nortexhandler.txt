Things to add/change to @nortex/handler:
- Usage should be concatonated with the prefix + command
- Set cooldown function which sets per-execution cooldown
- Make interaction handling not automatic and instead require runInteraction() method like classic
- Set prefix method (even though assigning manually works)
- Additional readable parameters to CommandExecutionErrors like remaining cooldown
- (?) Built-in subcommand support for subcommands in commands (maybe as Util)
- Fetchers utility with sharding support
- Built-in Prompters
- Make paths relative instead of absolute
- More debug logss
- Regex of filenames to load commands from (?)
- Append handler to command class
- All additional command ...options should be available in `this.x`
- Make sure promise resolves synchronously (dont wait for actual execution)
- Change commands and interactions Map to a custom Collection
